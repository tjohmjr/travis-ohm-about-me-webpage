                            assistant for Meticulous Modernizations. It was a job I obtained from a family friend who had worked on numerous 
                            construction projects for my family. While working this job I learned the uses of different tools and equipment
                            within construction. I also learned information about contracts, architecture, and a handful of other useful documents.
                            It was a very informative job I had acquired.</p>

                        trained on every single other role in the restaurant. I always made sure to stay busy and have something to do. I learned
                        skills such as customer service, culinary skills, efficiency, cleanliness, multi-tasking, and the importance of a team.
