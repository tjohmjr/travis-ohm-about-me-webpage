                    important thing in my life. I played it everyday and watched it everyday. My favorite team to watch is the Boston Red Sox.
                    Throughout all the years I played I only ever was a first baseman and catcher. I played high school JV and Varsity for two
                    years each, and I also played on a competitive prospects team. I met my best friends even to this day through baseball.</p>

                    started lifting weights to get stronger for baseball, but then over time I started lifting to get stronger in general and
                    for stress relief. Now, I look forward to going to the gym every day.</p>

                    there were graduating so they needed new ones. My friend, Aiden, and I decided to volunteer. We both really enjoy listening
                    and playing various types of songs. We also enjoyed the idea of entertaining others. We still continue to DJ to this day.</p>

                    the basics of computers and the language HTML. The teacher who taught the class was the main reason I enjoy coding and decided to
                    take computer science in college. He was always so helpful and encouraging. I excelled in that class and since them I have been doing
                    personal projects on my own and trying to learn everything I can.</p>
